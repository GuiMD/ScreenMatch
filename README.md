# ScreenMatch Project  

The **ScreenMatch** project is developed step by step in the **"Java: Applying Object-Oriented Programming"** course from Alura.  

Its goal is to teach all the fundamental concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** while providing a detailed demonstration of how these concepts are implemented in the **Java** language.
